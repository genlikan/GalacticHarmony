Machine Learning Journey in Space Object Classification


The data set star_classification.csv contains 100,000 different spectral objects in space. 
| Galaxies |      Stars  |  Quasars |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| 59,445   |  21,594       | 18,961|

The purpose of this code is to use machine learning models to accurately predict which spectral object weâ€™re investigating based on initial spectral properties.
The variables u, g, r, i, z are photometric filters used in the SDSS system to measure the amount of light from objects in different wavelength bands. Each filter corresponds to a different color of light, with u being in the ultraviolet range, g in green, r in red, i in near-infrared, and z in infrared.
The variable redshift value is based on the increase in wavelength of light emitted by the object due to its motion away from or towards the observer. It is a measure of how much the universe has expanded since the light was emitted by the object.
